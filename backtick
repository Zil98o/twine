There's not a whole lot I can remember, but at least I remember my name.

<center><big>Alright, I think that's it for now. I would split this in two parts for chapter 1? Let's see what's the word count! its ~10k including the code for the passage logic. I'm still pretty new to coding and writing in general, it's been overall fun so far, so I want to continue. 

Your saves file probably don't work in the future because I don't even implement the stats system yet in this version. But it still short read anyway right? I hope you don't mind, I would research how can I make sure old saves are compatible with newer version next time.

So... Thanks for reading it this far, hope you are excited for more. Enjoy your day, and please take care of yourself. I would see you next when I bring you more of my works!</big></center>

:: What's Next
- Meet Father.
- More adventures.
- Encounter with Grandmother.
- The later part of the story would be to attending to the academy. Maybe think of it like Highschool or University, I think it's a nice concept that can be quite easy to implement and interesting plot progression especially in interactive fiction. For now I want to establish relationship between the player and their close friends and family first. 

Anyway... Have you open the Credits page yet? If not open it: <<link "Credits">><<script>>
